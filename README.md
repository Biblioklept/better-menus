## Mod Merge Goals
- Provide a robust, bug-free merge that will work with any setup.
- Easy customizability by simply removing the lines of code you dont want to use.
- No feature overcreep, ala what happened to my "updated" version of Sniff Utils 2.
- Seperated sections of mods to provide a more "pick and choose experience".
